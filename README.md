# K-Nearest-Neighbor
This program implements the machine learning algorithm, K Nearest Neighbor on a set of data to classify a test data set based on its nearest neighbor. This KNN algorithm predicts the corruption perception index (CPI) of a test set based on its nearest neighbor. Each sample from the data set is unique Country ID. The features of the data are Life Expectancy, Top-10 Income, Infant Mortality, Millions Spend, and School Years. The target is the CPI.
